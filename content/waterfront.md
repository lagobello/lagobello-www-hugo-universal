# Waterfront Exclusivity

Discover the pinnacle of luxury living at Lago Bello. Our waterfront lots offer unparalleled views and direct access to the serene lake lifestyle.

## The Experience

Wake up to the gentle sounds of water and breathtaking sunrises. Lago Bello's waterfront properties are designed for those who demand the very best.

*   **Private Access:** Enjoy exclusive access to the lake from your own backyard.
*   **Premium Views:** Unobstructed vistas of the water and surrounding nature.
*   **Tranquility:** A secluded retreat just minutes from the city.

## The Lake

Nestled at the heart of the community is a 16-acre fresh water lake, the only one of its kind in Brownsville. When full, at its deepest point it will be around 20 feet deep, permitting large non-combustion watercraft with an accompanying dock. Currently, the water level is maintained to only "resaca" depth to support construction activities.

*   **Privately Owned:** The lake, streets, and Caminata are privately owned by the lot owners through the home owners association.
*   **HOA Maintained:** The lake and retention wall are fully owned and maintained by the Home Owners Association, ensuring pristine conditions year-round.
*   **Private Docks:** Homeowners have the right to build a private dock within the lake property at no additional charge.
*   **Eco-Friendly:** To preserve the tranquility and environment, only combustion-free watercraft (electric boats, kayaks, paddleboards, sail boats) are permitted.

## The Caminata

Complementing the waterfront lifestyle is *The Caminata*, a scenic trail system that offers residents a perfect setting for walking, jogging, and enjoying the natural beauty of Lago Bello.

## Exclusive Gated Community

Lago Bello is an exclusive gated community featuring 24/7 security, ensuring privacy and safety for all residents.
